# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following Data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail 
management event logs, Cloudtrail S3 data event logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and 
domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity within your AWS environment. This can include 
issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IP addresses, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty 
can detect compromised EC2 instances serving malware or mining bitcoin. It also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as unauthorized 
infrastructure deployments, like instances deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls, like a password policy change to reduce password 
strength.
